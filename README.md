## Base.fun/Dx.fun Smart Contract

Welcome to the Base.fun smart contract, inspired by Pump.fun. Our project is dedicated to emulating the features of Pump.fun, such as managing virtual liquidity providers (LPs), and establishing Uniswap pools. This Solidity/Hardhat smart contract is engineered to operate seamlessly across Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions.

Please understand if your forked code encounters issues. Certain sensitive elements have been intentionally omitted for security reasons, which we refer to as SECRET.

## As a seasoned Web3 developer with expertise across multiple blockchains, my ambition is to extend pumpdotfun-like capabilities to every blockchain platform.

The Solana adaptation is currently undergoing a phased update, while the Bitcoin adaptation has been finalized and is poised for imminent release.
