## Pump.fun/Dx.fun Smart Contract

Welcome to the Pump/Base.fun smart contract, inspired by Pump.fun. Our project is dedicated to emulating the features of Pump.fun, such as managing virtual liquidity providers (LPs), and establishing Uniswap pools. This Solidity/Hardhat smart contract is engineered to operate seamlessly across Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions.

Please understand if your forked code encounters issues. Certain sensitive elements have been intentionally omitted for security reasons, which we refer to as SECRET.

## As a seasoned Web3 developer with expertise across multiple blockchains, my ambition is to extend pumpdotfun-like capabilities to every blockchain platform.
